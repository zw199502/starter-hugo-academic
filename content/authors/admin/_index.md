I am a Poctdoc in Georgia Institute of Technology, co-working with Dr. [Ye Zhao](https://sites.google.com/site/yezhaout). I obtained my doctoral degree in robotics at the Department of Robotics, Graduate School of Engineering, Tohoku University, Japan, in 2023. My doctoral advisor was Prof. [Mitsuhiro Hayashibe](http://neuro.mech.tohoku.ac.jp/). I got my Master's and Bachelor's degrees from Nankai University, China, in 2020 and 2017 respectively. My master advisor was Prof. [Yongchun Fang](https://aien.nankai.edu.cn/2021/1108/c28086a418492/page.htm). My research interests include deep reinforcement learning, design and control for snake robots, motion control and planning for legged robots and robotic arms, autonomous navigation in static and dynamic environments.[CV](uploads/CV_WEI_ZHU.pdf).
