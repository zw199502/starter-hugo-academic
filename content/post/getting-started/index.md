title: Sampling Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Navigation with Raw Laser Scans
subtitle: Submitted for RA-L/IROS, 2022

# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: We proposed a DRL model for autonomous navigation in dynamic environments directly using raw Laser scans. We deployed the model in ROS/Gazebo using a differential mobile robot and real worlds with a quadruped robot.
