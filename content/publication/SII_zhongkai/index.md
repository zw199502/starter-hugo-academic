abstract: Although considerable research in humanoid robotics focuses on developing general manipulation capabilities, whole-body manipulation, leveraging all body links for manipulation tasks, has received limited attention. Whole-body manipulation is particularly advantageous when robotic hands face constraints or when simultaneous carrying of multiple objects is required. To explore the potential of whole-body manipulation, we propose a framework enabling humanoid robots to carry multiple objects simultaneously using their entire body. We introduce two types of whole-body manipulation, under-arm holding and wrist-to-torso holding, significantly expanding humanoid robot manipulation capabilities. We demonstrate that compliant control effectively stabilizes object holding using body links.We integrate existing humanoid whole-body controllers, such as AMO and HOMIE, with a dynamic feedforward PD controller, providing precise upperbody movements essential for manipulation tasks alongside locomotion capabilities.
